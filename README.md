# Pig Game

A fun, interactive dice game for two players, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎲 Game Rules

- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- Each roll (except rolling a 1) adds to the player's current score.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost and the turn passes to the other player.
- Players can choose to "Hold" to add their current score to their total score and pass the turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game!

## 🚀 Features

- Animated dice roll and player transitions.
- Modal with game rules.
- Confetti animation for the winner.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Keyboard shortcuts:  
  - `r` to roll the dice  
  - `h` to hold  
  - `Escape` to reset the game
